# ⚠️ Critical Stripe Configuration Issue

## Problem Identified:
Your Stripe account `pmc_1RAMysCHc12x7sCzgYxvqmnb` is a **Connected Account** managed by "My Golden Digits Pty Ltd" platform. This prevents direct payment processing.

## Why Payments Are Failing:
1. **Platform Restriction**: Payment methods are controlled by the platform
2. **No Direct Access**: Cannot create payment sessions directly
3. **OAuth Required**: Must use platform's OAuth flow for payments

## Your Current Setup:
- Account Type: Connected Account (Restricted)
- Platform: My Golden Digits Pty Ltd
- Payment Methods: Platform-managed (not self-managed)
- Direct Payments: ❌ Disabled

## Solutions:

### Solution 1: Use Platform Integration (Quick Fix)
```javascript
// Instead of direct Stripe, use platform's OAuth
const stripe = new Stripe(PLATFORM_SECRET_KEY, {
  stripeAccount: 'pmc_1RAMysCHc12x7sCzgYxvqmnb' // Your connected account
});
```

Contact "My Golden Digits Pty Ltd" for:
- Platform API credentials
- OAuth setup instructions
- Revenue sharing configuration

### Solution 2: Create Independent Stripe Account (Recommended)
1. Go to https://stripe.com
2. Sign up for a NEW account (not connected)
3. Complete verification
4. Get your own API keys
5. Full control over payments

### Solution 3: Modify Current Account
1. Click "View settings" in Stripe Dashboard
2. Look for "Disconnect from platform" option
3. Request independent payment processing
4. May require platform approval

## Code Changes Needed:

### For Connected Account (Current):
```javascript
// src/app/api/checkout/stripe-connect/route.ts
import Stripe from 'stripe';

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.PLATFORM_SECRET_KEY!, {
  apiVersion: '2024-06-20',
});

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // Create payment on connected account
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    line_items: [...],
    mode: 'payment',
    success_url: '...',
    cancel_url: '...',
  }, {
    stripeAccount: 'pmc_1RAMysCHc12x7sCzgYxvqmnb' // Your account
  });
  
  // Platform takes commission automatically
}
```

### For Independent Account (Recommended):
```javascript
// Standard Stripe integration
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
  apiVersion: '2024-06-20',
});

// Direct payment processing - no platform
```

## Revenue Implications:

### With Platform (Current):
- Platform takes commission (usually 10-30%)
- They handle compliance
- Limited control

### With Independent Account:
- Keep 100% revenue (minus Stripe fees 2.9% + 30¢)
- Full control
- Your own compliance

## Immediate Action Required:

### Option A: Contact Platform (Today)
Email "My Golden Digits Pty Ltd":
```
Subject: API Access for Custom Integration

Hi,

We need API credentials to process payments through our custom checkout.
Please provide:
1. Platform API keys
2. OAuth setup documentation
3. Revenue share details

Account: pmc_1RAMysCHc12x7sCzgYxvqmnb
```

### Option B: Create New Account (1 Hour)
1. Sign up at https://stripe.com
2. Use different email than current
3. Complete business verification
4. Add bank account
5. Get API keys
6. Update .env.local

## Testing the Issue:
The error "Invalid API Key provided: sk_live_***" happens because:
- You're using direct Stripe keys
- But your account requires platform authentication
- The keys don't have permission for direct access

## Resolution Timeline:
- **Platform Integration**: 1-2 days (waiting for their response)
- **New Stripe Account**: 1-2 hours (immediate control)
- **Current Account Modification**: Unknown (requires platform approval)

---

**Recommendation**: Create an independent Stripe account for full control over your payment processing. This is blocking your entire checkout flow.
