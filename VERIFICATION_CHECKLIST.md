# ✅ Verification Checklist - Before Next Move

## What We Know For Sure:

### 1. Supabase Database Status
- ✅ Products exist in Supabase (you showed query results)
- ✅ RLS was blocking access 
- ✅ You ran SQL that returned products (Emerald Green Vest, etc.)
- ❓ Did you disable RLS or create new policies?

### 2. Main Project (This One) Status
- ✅ Environment variables are correct
- ✅ Supabase client is connecting
- ❌ API endpoint still showing "permission denied"
- ❓ Did we clear cache after RLS fix?

### 3. Backend Project (In Cursor) Status
- ❓ Does it have the same Supabase credentials?
- ❓ Is it connecting to the SAME database?
- ❓ Can it see products yet?

## Before We Move Forward:

### VERIFY #1: Check RLS Status
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename = 'products';
```
- If `rowsecurity` = false → RLS is disabled (products should load)
- If `rowsecurity` = true → Need to check policies

### VERIFY #2: Test Main Project Again
Since we restarted the server, try:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-supabase
```
- Should show success if RLS is fixed
- If still fails, we have a different issue

### VERIFY #3: Check Both Projects Use Same Database
In Backend project's `.env` or `.env.local`:
- MUST have same Supabase URL: `https://gvcswimqaxvylgxbklbz.supabase.co`
- MUST have same anon key ending in: `...5Lg24`

## The Core Problem We're Solving:
1. Main project has local products + needs Supabase products
2. Backend manages 500+ products in Supabase
3. When one works, the other breaks
4. Need BOTH to work with SAME data

## Next Move Decision Tree:

### IF Main Project API Shows Success:
→ Backend just needs to copy the working code

### IF Main Project Still Shows Permission Denied:
→ RLS isn't actually fixed
→ Need to verify in Supabase dashboard

### IF Projects Use Different Databases:
→ That's why they break each other
→ Must use same credentials

## Questions Before Moving:
1. What does `SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'products';` show?
2. What does `curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-supabase` show now?
3. Does backend project have exact same Supabase URL and key?

Let's answer these before the next step!
