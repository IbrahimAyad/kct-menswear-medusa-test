- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry)

### Final Checks
- [ ] SEO optimization
- [ ] Analytics implementation
- [ ] Legal pages (Privacy, Terms)
- [ ] SSL certificates
- [ ] Load testing

## Daily Sync Protocol

### Morning Sync (Both Projects)
1. Check Supabase data integrity
2. Verify no breaking changes
3. Review error logs
4. Plan day's tasks

### Evening Sync
1. Test critical features
2. Document any changes
3. Update shared services if needed
4. Commit stable code

## Critical Success Factors

### Data Consistency
- Both projects MUST use same Supabase schema
- Shared service functions prevent divergence
- Regular data integrity checks

### Communication
- Document all major changes
- Use clear commit messages
- Keep README files updated
- Share error solutions

### Testing Strategy
- Test after every major change
- Both projects test together
- Automated tests prevent regressions
- Manual testing for UX

## Emergency Protocols

### If Products Stop Loading
1. Check Supabase RLS policies
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test with hardcoded credentials
4. Check for schema changes

### If Images Break
1. Verify R2 bucket access
2. Check image URLs in database
3. Test upload functionality
4. Verify CDN configuration

### If Sync Issues Occur
1. Compare service files
2. Check for uncommitted changes
3. Verify same Supabase instance
4. Reset and re-sync if needed

## Next Immediate Actions

### Today (Both Projects)
1. Complete Phase 1 synchronization
2. Create shared test suite
3. Document current state
4. Set up error monitoring

### This Week
1. Security hardening
2. Performance baseline
3. Feature completion
4. Testing framework

### Before Launch
1. Full security audit
2. Load testing
3. Backup procedures
4. Rollback plan

## Success Metrics
- âœ… Both projects use identical Supabase service
- âœ… Zero sync-related bugs
- âœ… Page load < 3 seconds
- âœ… 99.9% uptime
- âœ… Conversion rate > 3%
