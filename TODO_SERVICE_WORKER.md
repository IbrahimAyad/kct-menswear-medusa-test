# Service Worker Re-implementation Plan

## Status: PENDING (Awaiting Medusa Migration Completion)

### Background
The service worker was temporarily removed on 2025-08-31 during the Supabase to Medusa migration to resolve persistent caching and WebSocket errors.

### Original Features to Re-implement
1. **Offline Support**
   - Cache essential pages for offline browsing
   - Serve cached content when network unavailable
   - Display offline fallback page

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cache static assets (images, CSS, JS)
   - Implement cache-first strategy
   - Reduce server requests

3. **PWA Features**
   - Enable "Add to Home Screen"
   - Make site installable as PWA
   - App-like navigation experience

4. **Background Functionality**
   - Cart data synchronization
   - Push notifications for orders
   - Background content updates

### Prerequisites Before Re-implementation
- [ ] Medusa migration fully complete
- [ ] All API endpoints stable
- [ ] No remaining Supabase references
- [ ] User authentication working properly
- [ ] Cart functionality fully operational

### Implementation Checklist
When ready to re-implement, ensure:
- [ ] Get explicit approval from Ibrahim before proceeding
- [ ] Update all cached URLs to use Medusa endpoints
- [ ] Test offline functionality thoroughly
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add version management for cache updates
- [ ] Test on multiple devices and browsers
- [ ] Document cache invalidation strategy

### Files to Create/Modify
1. `public/sw.js` - New service worker file
2. `src/components/pwa/ServiceWorkerRegistry.tsx` - Re-enable registration
3. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Switch from Unregister to Registry
4. `public/offline.html` - Offline fallback page
5. `public/manifest.json` - Update PWA manifest if needed

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test offline mode works correctly
- [ ] Verify no console errors
- [ ] Check cache updates properly
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify PWA installation works
- [ ] Test push notifications (if implemented)

### Notes
- Original service worker removed in commit: c233471
- Removal PR: "Remove service worker to fix persistent errors"
- Original implementation was causing FetchEvent errors and WebSocket connection attempts to old Supabase endpoints
